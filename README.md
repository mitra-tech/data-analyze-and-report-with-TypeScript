# football-data-analize-and-report-with-TypeScript
 Getting data from a .csv file and based on the data analizing and reporting diffrent data for the team/teams
 ### When should we use enums generally:
 - Follow near-identical syntax rules as normal objects
 - Creates an object with the same keys and values when converted from TS to JS
 - Primary goal is to signal to other developers that these are all closely related values
 - Use whenever we have a small fixed set of values that are all closely related and known at compile time
 
  ### Type Assertion : 
  When we try to overwrite TypeScript's default behavior.
  We can use it with any kind of type, it is not limited just to be in used with enums.

### Tuple
Is very similar to an array but it's meant to organize elements inside of it in a very specific order
Refactoring the CsvFileReader type definition to make it reuseable for any other kind of types (In case of extending the data in the future)


### Abstract Classes: turning the CsvFile into an Abstract Class (Abstract Classes in TS: theey are classes that we are never going to use to create an instance of an object) so not creating an instance of the CsvFile any more. The abstract method is going to be implemented by some child classes.
