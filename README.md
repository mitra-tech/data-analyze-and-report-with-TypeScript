 Getting data from a .csv file and based on the data analizing and reporting diffrent data for the team/teams
 ### When should we use enums generally:
 - Follow near-identical syntax rules as normal objects
 - Creates an object with the same keys and values when converted from TS to JS
 - Primary goal is to signal to other developers that these are all closely related values
 - Use whenever we have a small fixed set of values that are all closely related and known at compile time
 
  ### Type Assertion : 
  When we try to overwrite TypeScript's default behavior.
  We can use it with any kind of type, it is not limited just to be in used with enums.
